# OSU Residents Schedule App

A small app I made to help keep track of the OSU Hospital resident schedule.

## Directions 

* Clean up the excel sheet
  - Remove all the sheets except the one you want to load
  - Remove any extra columns (like a legend)

* Run the parse script


## TODO List

[ ] Add Github actions to automatically deploy to AWS when pushsed
[ ] Make it easier to manipulate the database
